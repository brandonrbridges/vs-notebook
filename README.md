## Features

- **Robust Note Storage**  
  All notes are stored as Markdown with YAML frontmatter in a dedicated `.vs-notebook` directory, supporting version control, audit trails, and easy backup.

- **Multi-Level Organization**  
  Group notes by file, tag, or view all in a flat list. Supports granular organization for large codebases and cross-team projects.

- **Advanced Tagging & Prioritization**  
  Add comma-separated tags to any note. Special tags (e.g., `important`, `feature`, `bug`, `todo`, `refactor`) trigger custom icons and behaviors. Notes tagged as `important` are always shown at the top, sorted alphabetically, and display an exclamation mark icon.

- **Global & Workspace Notes**  
  Create notes tied to specific files, code blocks, or globally for project-wide documentation and knowledge sharing.

- **Powerful Sidebar & Search**  
  Dedicated sidebar for browsing, searching, and managing notes. Filter and search notes by content, tag, or file.

- **Contextual Actions & Code Lens Integration**  
  Inline indicators show the number of notes per line or block. Context menu actions for quick update, rename, or delete.

- **Real-Time Sync & File Watching**  
  Notes are automatically refreshed in the sidebar and Code Lens when files are added, changed, or deleted. Supports both workspace and global notes directories.

- **Customizable Settings**  
  Configure grouping, appearance, and behaviors via extension settings. Easily access settings from the sidebar.

- **Version Control & Compliance**  
  All notes are version-controlled, supporting audit requirements and team collaboration.

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**  
  Automated tests ensure stability and correct behavior for note creation, grouping, searching, and file watching.
